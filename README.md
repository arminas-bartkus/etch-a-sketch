# etch-a-sketch
** THIS PROJECT IS AN ODIN PROJECT TRAINING EXERCISE **


This project is about combining my HTML, 
CSS, and JS knowledge all into one. 

The goal here is to produce an etch-a-sketch
like webpage. The requirements are as follows:

- Generate a fixed sized 16x16 grid using JS
and flexbox
- Introduce a hover effect to the user mouse,
where, hoving over a grid space will change its
colour
- Add functionality via a button/popup combo to
allow the user to customise the size of the grid
from 1x1 to 100x100 (all within that original size)
- Extra credit involves: randomising the colour, that
hovering the mouse of the grid produces and producing
a progressive darkening effect equal to 10% per grid
space hovered over. (i.e. full opacity within 10
interactions.)
